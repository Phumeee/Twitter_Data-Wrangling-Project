Introduction

Data Wrangling is the process of transforming raw data into readily usable formats. It involves gathering, assessing, cleaning, and even merging data to make it usable for analysis. This project wrangles data from 'WeRateDogs', a twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The data required for analysis was scattered across three datasets, as shown in the data gathering phase. The gathered data was assessed, both visually and programmatically, for quality and tidiness issues. All the assessed issues were cleaned and the final dataset saved to a csv file for analysis. Afterwards, the wrangled data was analyzed to generate interesting insights and visualizations on WeRateDogs.

The analysis tried to answer the following questions:
1. What are the most popular dog breeds on WeRateDogs?
2. What are the least popular dog breeds?
3. What are the top five breeds with the highest rating scores?
4. What dog breeds have the lowest rating scores?
5. Is there any correlation between rating score, favorite count and retweet count?
6. Does favorite count have an effect on rating score?
7. What days have the highest retweet and favorite counts?
